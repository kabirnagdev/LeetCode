### 📜 Problem Description

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in  **adjacent**  plots.

Given an integer array  `flowerbed`  containing  `0` 's and  `1` 's, where  `0`  means empty and  `1`  means not empty, and an integer  `n` , return  `true`   *if*   `n`   *new flowers can be planted in the*   `flowerbed`   *without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and*   `false`   *otherwise* .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
	
- `flowerbed[i]`  is  `0`  or  `1` .
	
- There are no two adjacent flowers in  `flowerbed` .
	
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`
